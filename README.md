Trail of Light

Overview

Trail of Light is a 2D side-scrolling web game in which you guide Minka, a stray cat with bioluminescent eyes, through a world plunged into endless night. A monstrous creature named Umbra has stolen the last starry glow, and Minka’s friend Lux—the final spark of hope—has been captured. Your goal is to collect light fragments scattered throughout the darkness while avoiding monsters. If you manage to gather 10 fragments, you restore hope—at least for a little while!
